# nrn-modeldb-ci

## Installation

In your virtual environment, install in editable mode: 

```
pip install -e .
```

NOTE: You have to install NEURON by yourself (wheel, CMake install).

## Usage

The following commands are now available:

* `getmodels` -> retrieve all or specified models from ModelDB.
  ```
  getmodels -h
  ```

  
* `runmodels` -> run `nrn-modeldb-ci` for all or specified models.
  ```
  runmodels -h
  ```
  Note that models have to be downloaded beforehand with `getmodels`.
  You can specify `--virtual` so that NEURON GUI is run in headless mode. It requires a backend (n.r. `Xvfb`).
  Re-running in the same `--workdir` can mangle results. Please use `--clean` if you wish to re-run in the same `--workdir`.
  

* `report2html` -> create an interactive HTML report for a given json report (obtained with `runmodels`)
  ```
  report2html -h
  ```
  Note that the generated HTML file is self-contained.


* `diffgout` -> launch `nrngui` and display the two gout files in different colors.
  ```
  diffgout -h
  ```
  This can come in handy when comparing/investigating results from binary incompatible neuron versions. 


* `diffreports2html` -> create an interactive `NEURONv1-vs-NEURONv2` HTML report 
  ```
  diffreports2html -h
  ```
  The differences that are taken into account:
  * `nrn_run` and `moderr` from the json reports -> outputs side-by-side diffs
  * `gout` -> outputs git-like diffs; **NOTE**: this walks gout paths from json report `run_info`, make sure they are present.
  
  Note that the generated HTML file is self-contained.
  

* `modeldb-config` -> list configuration for `nrn-modeldb-ci`:
  ```
    modeldb-config
  ```
    
  | Config                  | Details                                                                     |

  | ROOT_DIR                | location of `nrn-modeldb-ci` installation                                   |
  | MODELDB_ROOT_DIR        | path to `modeldb` package inside `nrn-modeldb-ci`                           |
  | MODELDB_RUN_FILE        | yaml file containing run instructions for models (required for `runmodels`) |
  | MODELDB_METADATA_FILE   | yaml file containing model info for those downloaded with `getmodels`       |
  | MODELS_ZIP_DIR          | location of cache folder for models populated via `getmodels`               |
  | MDB_NEURON_MODELS_URL   | url used to get list of all NEURON model ids (necessary for `getmodels`)    |
  | MDB_MODEL_DOWNLOAD_URL  | url template used for model downloading (cf `{model_id}`)                   |

## Model Run

### MODELDB_RUN_FILE 

This is where the "black magic" lives, instructions on how to run models from ModelDB. 
Default handling is available in case there are no entries for a given model id. 

All entries are optional:

| yaml entry | special value   | Details                                                       | Default handling       |
| ---        | ---             | ----                                                          | ---                    |
| run        |                 | custom instructions used to effectively run the model         | `verify_graph_()`     *|
| run        | null            | `DoNotRun` mode -> model is built but not run                 ||
| model_dir  |                 | custom location of `mod` sub-directory to compile             | `*.mod` @ root level   |
| model_dir  | dir;dir         | several custom `mod` sub-directories to compile               | `*.mod` @ root level   |
| skip       |                 | model is skipped from running alltogether                     ||
| comment    |                 | comment to be included in the report for `skip` or `run: null`||
| script     |                 | bash script entries needed to adjust the model before running ||

(*) `verify_graph_()` saves all lines of all graphs to the `gout` file in the model working directory.

### Report

The generated report following `runmodels` contains te following info:

* `gout` - (optional) graph data from the neuron execution (must be run with `runmodels --gout`)
* `logs` - logs regarding model setup, nrnivmodl, ...
* `nrn_run` - command used to run the model and its output
* `run_info` - model run information
* `run_time` - model run time

For example, by running:
```
runmodels --gout --workdir=test3682 3682
```
we will generate report `test3782.json` :
```yaml
{
    "0": {...} # runmodels stats, see next section

        "gout": [

Every `runmodels` report will hold out run statistics in the `"0"` key: 
```yaml
